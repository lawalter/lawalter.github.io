## Research

### Red-headed Woodpeckers

As part of my Master's work with the [Bulluck Avian Ecology Lab](https://rampages.us/bullucklab/), I studied [Red-headed Woodpecker](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Red-headed_Woodpecker/overview) (<i>Melanerpes erythrocephalus</i>) parental care behavior. Below is a summary of my research using a series of infographics. To learn more, check out my [parental care publication](https://journal.afonet.org/vol93/iss2/art3/JFO-2022-89.pdf).

![](images/rhwo_parental_care.png){fig-alt="Red-headed Woodpecker parental care results summary. Ninety-nine percent of all woodpecker species are sexually dimorphic; less than one percent are truly monomorphic. Red-headed and Lewis's Woodpeckers are the only monomorphic woodpeckers. Since males and females are hard to tell apart in monomorphic species, parental care behaviors are often under-studied. We used DNA to sex color-banded Red-headed Woodpeckers and video-recorded their parental care. Males did nearly all of the nest cleaning. Provisioning, also known as feeding chicks, was equal. Incubation and diurnal brooding was done by females more." fig-align="center"}

## Apps

### Garden Helpr

**Repository:** [https://github.com/lawalter/gardenhelpr](https://github.com/lawalter/gardenhelpr)<br>**In development.** 2022-present

I started this R Shiny app to assist in backyard garden planning. Initially, I had an idea to calculate the mean pH requirements of all of the plants I was hoping to grow in my yard. As I did more research, I learned about the benefits of companion planting (and drawbacks to planting "enemies" together)! When completed, the gardenhelpr app will be able to take a list of plants a user is planning to grow and output both (1) ideal growing conditions (pH, soil, light, etc) as well as (2) any plant relationships and subsequent spacing recommendations.

### Colorband Combination Generator

**Repository:** [https://github.com/lawalter/colorband-app](https://github.com/lawalter/colorband-app)<br>**Complete.** 2020

Created as a test case for my <a href = "https://github.com/lawalter/r-shiny-electron-app">r-shiny-electron-app</a> repository, this is a simple R Shiny app packaged with Electron that creates random color combinations for bird banding. Colors can be selected based on what's available in a banding kit, and selections are saved for future use via <a href = "https://github.com/trestletech/shinyStore">shinyStore</a>.
