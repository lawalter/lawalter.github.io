I started this R Shiny app to assist in backyard garden planning. Initially, I had an idea to calculate the mean pH requirements of all of the plants I was hoping to grow in my yard. As I did more research, I learned about the benefits of companion planting (and drawbacks to planting "enemies" together)! When completed, the gardenhelpr app will be able to take a list of plants a user is planning to grow and output both (1) ideal growing conditions (pH, soil, light, etc) as well as (2) any plant relationships and subsequent spacing recommendations.

Created as a test case for my <a href = "https://github.com/lawalter/r-shiny-electron-app">r-shiny-electron-app</a> repository, this is a simple R Shiny app packaged with Electron that creates random color combinations for bird banding. Colors can be selected based on what's available in a banding kit, and selections are saved for future use via <a href = "https://github.com/trestletech/shinyStore">shinyStore</a>.
