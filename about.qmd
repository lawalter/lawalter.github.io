I am a certified [Associate Wildlife Biologist](https://wildlife.org/learn/professional-development-certification/certification-programs/) with a B.Sc. from the University of Delaware and M.Sc. from the [Bulluck Avian Ecology Lab](https://rampages.us/bullucklab/) at Virginia Commonwealth University. Most of my background is in wildlife biology, but I also like coding and programming. I learned how to wrangle data at the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center and now work analyzing data for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Migratory Bird Program. In my free time, I enjoy camping, traveling, and birding with my wife and dog.
