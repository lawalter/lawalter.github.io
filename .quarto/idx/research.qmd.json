Withput plumage or significant size differences, they look virtually identical. And they're both great parents! Below is a summary of my research using a series of infographics. To learn more, check out my [parental care publication](https://journal.afonet.org/vol93/iss2/art3/JFO-2022-89.pdf) or [data repository](https://github.com/lawalter/rhwo-parental-care).\n\n![](images/rhwo_parental_care.png){fig-alt=\"Red-headed Woodpecker parental care results summary. Ninety-nine percent of all woodpecker species are sexually dimorphic; less than one percent are truly monomorphic. Red-headed and Lewis's Woodpeckers are the only monomorphic woodpeckers. Since males and females are hard to tell apart in monomorphic species, parental care behaviors are often under-studied. We used DNA to sex color-banded Red-headed Woodpeckers and video-recorded their parental care. Males did nearly all of the nest cleaning. Provisioning, also known as feeding chicks, was equal. Incubation and diurnal brooding was done by females more.\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n![](images/provisioning.png){fig-alt=\"Male and female provisioning rates are equal. Red-headed Woodpeckers fed their chicks less frequently in late summer, after July 7, regardless of chick age.\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n![](images/cleaning_nest.png){fig-alt=\"Males were 6 and a half times more likely than females to clean the nest of fecal sacs. Future researchers can sex Red-headed Woodpeckers using cleaning rates as an affordable alternative to DNA sequencing.\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Nestling development\n\nMy paper's [appendix](https://journal.afonet.org/vol93/iss2/art3/JFO-2022-89.pdf) contains details regarding Red-headed Woodpecker nestling development. Benchmarks in growth can be used in future research to determine chick ages in nests with unknown hatch dates.\n\n![](images/nestling_development.png){fig-alt=\"Red-headed Woodpeckers hatch asynchronously. Pinfeathers emerge at day 7 and eyes open on day 11.\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Chick fledge events\n\nRed-headed Woodpecker parents work tirelessly for the day their chicks leave the nest. In all of the hours recording videos at active nest cavities we managed to capture footage of a chick fledging on two occasions. Though not of cinematic quality, this footage captures a life history event that was not previously documented. Both fledging videos are archived at the Macaulay Library ([ML488612](https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/488612), [ML488613](https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/488613)). \n\n## Home range size\n\nThis work is yet to be published but is well documented in my [Master's thesis](https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/etd/6000/). We estimated home range sizes of 25 breeding adult Red-headed Woodpeckers using PinPoint GPS tags and 95% kernel density estimates. Based on this preliminary analysis, we determined Red-headed Woodpecker males have larger home ranges than females, though this difference is not significant. \n\n## Crown feather reflectance\n\nWe collected crown feathers from 68 banded Red-headed Woodpeckers. From the feather samples, we measured carotenoid content and overall brightness. These data are still being analyzed; we plan to assess whether individual parental care effort is related to feather ornamentation, and/or if males and females can be distinguished using feather reflectance."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["css/styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"research.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":["litera","css/custom_blue.scss"],"title":"Red-headed Woodpecker Research","page-layout":"full"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
