Below are some past and current projects started on the weekends or during internships, mostly made with R or R Shiny. I am currently honing my Python skills and also trying to learn Julia. \n\nI've only included my personal projects on this page. To see the R packages I created and maintain for work, check out the official [USFWS GitHub](https://github.com/USFWS).\n\n\n::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}\n\n<div class=\"card bg-light mb-3\">\n  <div class=\"card-header\">gardenhelpr</div>\n  <div class=\"card-body\">\n  ![](images/gh_app.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of Garden Helper application\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n<span class=\"badge rounded-pill bg-warning\">In development</span> <span class=\"badge rounded-pill bg-secondary\">2022-present</span> [{{< fa brands github title = \"GitHub link to Garden Helper repository\" >}}](https://github.com/lawalter/gardenhelpr)\n\n<p class=\"card-text\">I started this R Shiny app to assist in backyard garden planning. Initially, I had an idea to calculate the mean pH requirements of all of the plants I was hoping to grow in my yard. As I did more research, I learned about the benefits of companion planting (and drawbacks to planting \"enemies\" together)! When completed, the gardenhelpr app will be able to take a list of plants a user is planning to grow and output both (1) ideal growing conditions (pH, soil, light, etc) as well as (2) any plant relationships and subsequent spacing recommendations.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}\n\n<div class=\"card bg-light mb-3\">\n  <div class=\"card-header\">Colorband Combination Generator</div>\n  <div class=\"card-body\">\n  ![](images/app_img_m.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of Colorband Combination desktop app\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n<span class=\"badge rounded-pill bg-success\">Complete</span> <span class=\"badge rounded-pill bg-secondary\">2020</span> [{{< fa brands github title = \"GitHub link to Colorband Combination Generator repository >}}](https://github.com/lawalter/colorband-app) \n\n<p class=\"card-text\">Created as a test case for my [r-shiny-electron-app](https://github.com/lawalter/r-shiny-electron-app) repository, this is a simple R Shiny app packaged with Electron that creates random color combinations for bird banding.
