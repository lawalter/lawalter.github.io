Initially, I had an idea to calculate the mean pH requirements of all of the plants I was hoping to grow in my yard. As I did more research, I learned about the benefits of companion planting (and drawbacks to planting \"enemies\" together)! When completed, the gardenhelpr app will be able to take a list of plants a user is planning to grow and output both (1) ideal growing conditions (pH, soil, light, etc) as well as (2) any plant relationships and subsequent spacing recommendations.\n\n### Colorband Combination Generator\n\n**Repository:** [https://github.com/lawalter/colorband-app](https://github.com/lawalter/colorband-app)<br>**Complete.** 2020\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n![](images/app_img_m.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of Colorband Combination app\"}\n:::\n\nCreated as a test case for my <a href = \"https://github.com/lawalter/r-shiny-electron-app\">r-shiny-electron-app</a> repository, this is a simple R Shiny app packaged with Electron that creates random color combinations for bird banding. Colors can be selected based on what's available in a banding kit, and selections are saved for future use via <a href = \"https://github.com/trestletech/shinyStore\">shinyStore</a>.\n\n## Guides \n\n###   Shiny Electron App Creation Guide \n\n**Repository:** [https://github.com/lawalter/r-shiny-electron-app](https://github.com/lawalter/r-shiny-electron-app)<br>**Complete.** 2020\n\nThis is a guide to creating a desktop R Shiny app on both macOS and Windows with Electron."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["css/styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"projects.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":["cosmo","css/custom.scss"],"linkcolor":"#60be65","title":"Projects"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
