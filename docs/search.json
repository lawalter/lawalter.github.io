Most of my background is in wildlife biology, but I also like coding and programming. I learned how to wrangle data at the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center and now work analyzing data for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Migratory Bird Program. In my free time, I enjoy camping, traveling, and birding with my wife and dog."
