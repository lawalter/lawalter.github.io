In 2017 and 2018, I recorded a few hundred hours of Red-headed Woodpecker (<i>Melanerpes erythrocephalus</i>) videos for my research on parental care behavior as part of my Master's work with the [Bulluck Avian Ecology Lab](https://rampages.us/bullucklab/). Woodpeckers were captured and given special leg bands in unique color combinations so I could tell them apart. Breeding pairs were then recorded at nest cavities from May to August at Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia, USA. I converted some of the most interesting clips into gifs to share with the public.

## Chick

Older woodpecker chicks often perch at the cavity entrance to watch the world outside.

## Cleaning

Most birds clean nestling waste from the nest or nest cavity when chicks are young.

## Drumming

Often done for territorial purposes.

## Preening

Important for cleanliness and to ensure feathers are in good shape for flying.

## Provisioning

Parents must provision, or bring food to, their offspring at the nest cavity.

## Resting

A common behavior also referred to as "nest guarding" when done near the nest.
