To collect data for my research on Red-headed Woodpecker (<i>Melanerpes erythrocephalus</i>) parental care behavior, I recorded a few hundred hours of video. The videos I recorded are of breeding pairs at nest cavities from 2017-2018 at Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia, USA. I converted some of the most interesting clips into gifs to share with the public, and invite you to use these under the <a href = "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA License</a>.

## Cleaning

Most birds clean nestling waste from the nest or nest cavity when chicks are young.

## Drumming

Often done for territorial purposes.

## Preening

Important for cleanliness and to ensure feathers are in good shape for flying.

## Provisioning

Parents must provision, or bring food to, their offspring at the nest cavity.

## Resting

A common behavior also referred to as "nest guarding" when done near the nest.

## Stretching

Birds stretch for the same reasons people do!
